Extract the bootstrap OS into the keow directory.
These are real linux executables (try them on a real linux box :-)

You should end up with a directory structure like this:

   keow\
      KernelEmulationOnWindows.exe
      ProcessStub.exe
      SysCalls.dll
      keow-bash.cmd
      linux\
          bin\
          lib\
          ...

Run keow-bash.cmd to start the bootstrap OS.
