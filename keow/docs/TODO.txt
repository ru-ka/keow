Ctrl-C handling problems
	sigint?
	bash only?? -- need bash source & gdb?
	maybe setjmp/longjmp problem?
	^--- pretty sure this is killing in-kernel code.
	(you can't receive a signal whilst in a kernel call??)
	(what about rt signals?)
	Need a debug &static version of bash to help debug this.

Need to split kernel code into seperate processes now?
	Allows consoles etc to have io (ctrl-c, sigint etc) when no process is reading.
	Makes debugging harder?
	Can you use gdb & vc++ at the same time.
	Can you use either?
	How does singlestep work?
	Does gdb to in-kernel debugging? can we do it?
	kernel process would need many threads.
	how much still needs to live in the actual process (eg mmap stuff)
	allows a kernel-module .ko loader?

Top crashes sometimes (/proc problem?)
